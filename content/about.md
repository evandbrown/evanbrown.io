I was born, raised, and educated in New Mexico. I moved to Seattle in 2005 after graduating from the University of New Mexico with a BS in Biology. I wanted to write software, but I didn't really want to be a biologist.

I started my career as a Bioinformatics Developer at [Seattle Biomed](http://www.seattlebiomed.org) and had the [chance to do work in Tanzania](http://p.evanbrown.io/Travel/Tanzania-2006). In 2008 I helped my buddy start [Enmetric Systems](https://www.enmetric.com/) - we went all-in on Amazon Web Services and I fell in love with cloud. In 2011 I went to work for Amazon, leading up the new technical training program as the first trainer. [I married Elli](http://evandbrown.smugmug.com/Other/Wedding) - the love of my life - in Chacala, Mexico on December 31 2011. I [traveled](http://p.evanbrown.io/Travel/Seoul-2012) [the](http://p.evanbrown.io/Travel/London-2012) [world](http://p.evanbrown.io/Travel/Oxford-2012) for a few years, then settled down working on the [Elastic Beanstalk](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk) and [CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) services.

June Koskella Brown - the apple of my eye - was born on May 6, 2014. A few hours after she was born, I wrote something in an e-mail to family that captured the moment:

> My infinite love to our eager June Koskella Brown, born at 10:03a on this beautiful day in Seattle. One month and one day early, 6lbs and 9oz large, she and her wonderful mother Elli are doing amazingly. My heart explodes.

I started at Google on September 29 2014. The office is just a few miles from home. The work is delightfully challenging, and I have a wonderful balance with home life - I get up with June every morning, and put her to bed at night. It's more than I could have ever hoped for.
