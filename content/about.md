I was born, raised, and educated in New Mexico. I moved to Seattle in 2005 after graduating from the University of New Mexico with a BS in Biology. I wanted to write software, but I didn't really want to be a biologist.

I started my career as a Bioinformatics Developer at [Seattle Biomed](http://www.seattlebiomed.org) and had the [chance to do work in Tanzania](http://p.evanbrown.io/Travel/Tanzania-2006). In 2008 I helped my buddy start Enmetric Systems - we went all-in on Amazon Web Services and I fell in love with cloud. In 2011 I went to work for Amazon, leading up the new technical training program as the first trainer. [I married Elli](http://evandbrown.smugmug.com/Family/Wedding) - the love of my life - in Chacala, Mexico on December 31 2011. I [traveled](http://p.evanbrown.io/Travel/Seoul-2012) [the](http://p.evanbrown.io/Travel/London-2012) [world](http://p.evanbrown.io/Travel/Oxford-2012) for a few years, then settled down working on the [Elastic Beanstalk](http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk) and [CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) services.

June Koskella Brown - the apple of my eye - was born on May 6, 2014. A few hours after she was born, I wrote something in an e-mail to family that captured the moment:

> My infinite love to our eager June Koskella Brown, born at 10:03a on this beautiful day in Seattle. One month and one day early, 6lbs and 9oz large, she and her wonderful mother Elli are doing amazingly. My heart explodes.

Otis Koskella Brown - the other apple of my other eye - was born on March 22, 2017. I was a lot more tired after he was born and didn't write any emails, but the sentiment was the same and my heart exploded again. I love those two more than I ever thought I could love anything.

I started at Google on September 29 2014 and worked on Cloud (especially Terraform support) and Google Domains until I took a brief hiatus for 6 months in early 2022 to work at Twitter until it went to shit. I came back to Google in September 2022 and lead the infrastructure team for BigQuery Omni. Our team runs Dremel on AWS and Azure - very challenging, very rewarding.

In the throes of COVID-19 we moved from Ballard to Bainbridge Island. We live on ~5 acres with all the responsibility that comes with maintaining that much space. I get to toot around on a tractor and riding mower, often wielding a chainsaw, and it's a great counterbalance to my tech career.
