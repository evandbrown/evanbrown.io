I took this photo in Oxford, England just outside the [Macdonald Randolph Hotel](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186361-d192508-Reviews-Macdonald_Randolph_Hotel-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html).

Dawn on July 18, 2012, I was heading to the train to get to London and go home to Seattle after a week of training AWS customers. Elli had flown from Boston to meet me in London the week before this. On a later trip to Oxford I stayed at the [Old Bank Hotel](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g186361-d192507-Reviews-Old_Bank_Hotel-Oxford_Oxfordshire_England.html) and it was a wonderful time.
