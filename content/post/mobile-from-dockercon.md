[Yesterday on Twitter](https://twitter.com/evandbrown/status/612753716249239552) I asked if anyone had tips for authoring and publishing with [Hugo](gohugo.io) from a mobile device. After a bit of hacking, I've cracked it (at least in a way that works for me.) All of this post was done from my iPhone. 

In a nutshell:

* Working Copy for iOS (amazing git client)
* TravisCI to build and push to S3
* Camera for pics (duh)
* Notes for writing (this can def be improved with a proper markdown editor)

Working Copy supports whatever that iOS feature is that lets you share things between apps. Here's me getting this post from Notes to Working Copy:

Proper tutorial post to come...
