We came to Maui last year (my first time in Hawaii) when Elli was pregnant with June. This year we brought her again. She was great on the 6+ hour flight and loves the water.

Food is a big part of vacations and we revisited a few favorites from last year. First was breakfast (and great whale sightings) at [The Gazebo](http://www.yelp.com/biz/gazebo-restaurant-lahaina). Fried rice and banana pancakes were on the menu:

We celebrated Pi Day at Leoda's Kitchen and Pie Shop (and also a few breakfasts and lunches there):

I also cooked a few spam and egg sandwiches:
