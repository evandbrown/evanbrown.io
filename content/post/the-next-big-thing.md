Nine years ago I was fortunate to sit next to Andy Leonard at [work](http://cidresearch.org). Andy introduced me to Amazon S3 when it launched and I had a gut feeling that this was the next thing. Then came EC2, and I was sure. I went to AWS a few years later to be a part of that.

Google released [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) in 2015, and it brought back memories of the S3 launch: This week I watched all 5 games of the AlphaGo vs Lee Se-dol match (great recap [here](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/15/11234816/alphago-vs-lee-sedol-go-game-recap)), and I was sure that this was big. Important, even. Machine intelligence, machine learning, and deep neural networks. In 2007 I allocated all of my personal hacking time to focus on S3, then EC2. That worked out well for me. This week, I pivot to machine learning.

Here's to the next big thing.
