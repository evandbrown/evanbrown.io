$140/mo - less than the cost of a car2go for 2 days.

This is a 2015 Smart ForTwo I got new from Mercedes Benz of Seattle. 4,500 miles, perfect condition. Automatic transmission with AC, power steering, cruise control, and radio. Averaging 35mpg around the city. 

There are 17 months remaining on the lease. Mercedes Benz would transfer the lease into your name, I will pay the $575 fee they charge to do that so you have no acquisition cost. 

The lease allows 21,500 miles. Less the 4,500 miles already on it, that leaves you with a balance of 17,000 miles. 

I got bored with it and bought a 4Runner because I'm still basically a child, but a child with discretionary income.
