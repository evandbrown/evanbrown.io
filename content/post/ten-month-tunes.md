Tunes (we call her that, short for Juney Tunes, short for Looney Tunes, coined in the weeks after she was born) will be 10 months in a few days. We were practicing our crawling today in undies in the living room and the light was great (February was good to Seattle).

I've ignored my Big Camera ([Nikon D7100](http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-D7100-24-1-DX-Format-Digital/dp/B00BI9X7UC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425276548&sr=8-1&keywords=nikon+d7100)) for a while because managing the hundreds of pictures that could come out of using it for just a few minutes was daunting. I'd take a lot of photos and they'd sit on the SD card for months. A few weeks ago I put together a workflow that makes it pretty quick work to surface a few keepers from any session, delete the no-keeps, and get everything up to SmugMug. I also use this workflow to solve my mobile photo problem. I'll write about that later this week.
