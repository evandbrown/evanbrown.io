This is a compilation of resources I've found useful while learning Go.

* [The Go Blog](http://blog.golang.org)
  * [Concurrency Patterns](http://blog.golang.org/pipelines), especially the section on bounded parallelism
* [Essential Go](https://www.kajabinext.com/courses/1-essential-go) video course by Jeremy Saenz (author of Martini, etc). If you're at square 1, this is a really good place to start (especially if you're familiar with Python/virtualenv and Ruby/rbenv, he gives a great explanation of GOROOT and GOHOME)
