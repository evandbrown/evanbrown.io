CenturyLink ran a fiber line to our home yesterday and installed/activated gigabit Internet and Prism TV. The installer, a guy named Chris,  was great: friendly, professional, on-time, and got everything up and working in a few hours. And the performance of the service is, so far, exactly what I'm paying for.

I wanted an RF remote control for the TV (the STB doesn't support an IR blaster), and the installer suggested I chat or call customer service to order one. So I popped open a chat, and ended up spending more than half an hour being transferred to 8 different people (and typing personally identifiable information to each of them; and my laptop battery died as I was being transferred to the 8th) before I gave up. I then spent over an hour on the phone, being transferred to 3 or 4 people before someone could order the remote. I'm not optimistic it will actually arrive.

I really, really, really hope I don't ever have any real problems that require troubleshooting. If this experience order a remote is any indication, it won't be resolved easily.

Here's the chat transcript:
