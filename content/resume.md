## Summary

I&#x27;ve deployed software in rural Tanzania in search of a malaria vaccine, built APIs and infra in the cloud for an IoT startup before cloud and IoT were cool, and led developer advocacy programs for CloudFormation and Elastic Beanstalk at Amazon Web Services. I currently work at Google as a Cloud Solutions Architect.

## Work

### Senior Cloud Solutions Architect, [Google](http://cloud.google.com)
##### September 2014 - present

I help customers run large-scale, reliable applications on Google Cloud Platform by working with engineers and architects to design, build, optimize, and operate infrastructure in the cloud. My specialties are systems automation, security, and migrating workloads to container-based deployments. In addition to helping customers build and deploy applications, I publish technical solutions and open source reference architectures to provide guidance and best-practices to a large audience.

### Senior Technical Program Manager, [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com)
##### May 2011 - August 2014

I joined AWS as the company's first technical trainer. I developed the flagship [Architecting on AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/training/course-descriptions/architect/) course, trained over 1400 customer and partner engineers, and led internal train-the-trainer efforts to scale a global team of more than 20 trainers.

In 2013 I moved internally to lead developer advocacy programs for CloudFormation and Elastic Beanstalk. I designed and built the first prototype of Docker support for Elastic Beanstalk, and helped drive it to [release](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-elastic-beanstalk-for-docker/), marking the first official support for Docker at AWS. I was a regular conference speaker and held [weekly live Hangouts](https://plus.google.com/events/cbopt34eu8frvp5214u4l7c4sds) covering technical material and answering questions.
